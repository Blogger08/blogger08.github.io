Lesson Review

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

This lesson I used common sense to work out how to do each exercise and my memory. In the activities I did this week it was all recapping what I have done in previous lessons. This is why you have to concentrate in the lessons as you will get tested on that subject in the future and there were also question which the website hasn't directly told you what to do but if you just think about it you will find the correct answer.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

This lesson the thing that limited my learning the most was my self esteem because of the people around me. It wasn't that they tricked me that I was behind them it was my fault that they are quite far ahead of me and even though I have the determination to catch up with them I was a little annoyed with myself as they had started at the same time as me but they were ahead of me. 

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next time I do this I will stop thinking it as a race and think it as it takes people different time to get to the end but everyone will turn out the same.
