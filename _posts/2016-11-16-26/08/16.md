**Shopping in Alex Lewis                ****06/11/17**

**Starting point:**

Using the code from previous lessons to help me in this task.

**Target for the lesson:**

To complete the stock and prices in the shop and buy things from the shop to find the overall value.

**Did I reach my target?**

I completed the task that I set for this lesson.

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

I believe that listening to what the teacher said was the main key in this lesson as he told us what to do in a step by step pattern only leaving certain bits of code for us to work out when we sat back down. I also found that working with others really does help as you can give them constructive feedback on what they have done wrong. You can also look back on your past work as it can tell you the answer to what you are struggling on.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I believe that the person next to me was a hindrance to my work because he is better than me at IT. It was like we were having a race meaning that I made more mistakes and it ended up taking longer than it should have because I wasn't concentrating properly on my work as it was like a competition.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

I will concentrate on my own work and will not mess around with coding as much.
