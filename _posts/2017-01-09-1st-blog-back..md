    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?
In this lesson I had to learn in lots of different ways. One of them was learning from my mistakes as I had a lot of them in my blog. I had to listen to the teacher who was telling the whole class what was wrong with my blog. This was beneficial for me and the whole class as I got to learn that if you make mistakes not everything will turn out to be okay and the class learned what not to do in your blog and answer the questions properly. I believe that this lesson will make people take more care in their work as they know what will happen to them.</td>

    <td>This lesson I think I did well to listen to the teacher in a situation that I had today. I normally tense up and just think of the worse that can happen to me and don't listen to the teacher while they are giving me constructive feedback. This lesson I did tense up a little bit so if I am going to improve on my work I need to concentrate on the teacher more than what was going to happen to me.</td>
