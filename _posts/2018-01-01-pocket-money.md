**Pocket money deals     4/12/17

**Starting point:

Starting with the basics of coding

**Target for the lesson:**

To use the code we all ready had to complete the worksheet.

**Did I reach my target?**

I completed the task that I set myself for this lesson.

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

In this lesson we were using the float() and int() tool to add up pocket money on the worksheet. The first bit of the code was given to us but we had to find out how to multiply the amount by two after every week. To work this out you had to think carefully about the code and what each of the code meant. Once you have done this it was quite easy to work out where to put the code and what to write.	

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

In this lesson I found out how to complete the first section of the worksheet very quickly and when I went to the second part it was harder so I wasn't as motivated to get through the exercise and I gave up after the first hurdle.  

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next week i am going to concentrate more and work through my exercise more thoroughly.
