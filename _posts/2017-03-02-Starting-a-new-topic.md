Lesson Review

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

This lesson I had to learn from my mistakes from last week's lesson and try to concentrate more on my work rather than the window. This is more important than the problems in the exercises because if I have full concentration on the question, the quicker I will complete it so I will do more work if I concentrate. Also it helps me for future lessons as I will remember the answer for future question in the Python course. The best way to complete each question is to read everthing as there will be phrase that tells you how to complete the question. THis helped me go up by 6% this lesson.

 

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

The thing that limited my learning was my understanding for the topic because if you don't know how to do something in any little way you will have no chance on completing. This is mainly because of my concentration levels of the lesson before so I havenâ€™t learnt anything and have just used the hints to my advantage. So if I try and work it out in every single different way I can think of I will use the hints less.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next time I will try and not use the clues as much as it is kind of cheating and the part it is telling me means that I am skipping out a part of the question.
