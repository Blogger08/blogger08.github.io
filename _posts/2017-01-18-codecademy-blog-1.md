Lesson Review

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

This lesson I was learning something that I hadn't even done before so I had to think in a different way than I normally do because I can’t use past knowledge to help me. One way that really helped me was reading every single word that was used to tell me how to do that certain thing as if you miss a whole section out it could have been a vital paragraph which helped you learn. Another strategy that I used was a very simple one, it is called perseverance because if you just gave up at the first hurdle you wouldn’t have got anywhere so just not giving up helped me. 

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

This lesson we did something new to me so it stopped me using past knowledge to help me with exercise so overall it slowed me down. I need to work on thinking outside the box so there might be something that just doesn't give you the answer by only thinking the little but thinking more widely and differently to what you first thought.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next time I will concentrate more on my work so It will be easier to understand when I am in a difficult situation and I will think more outside the box when I am on a question which i can't do.
