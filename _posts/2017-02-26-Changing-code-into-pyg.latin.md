Lesson Review

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

This lesson the best strategy was to think more direct about the task that I was doing rather than staring at the monitor hoping that the answer to the question would pop into my head. Unfortunately I only got this strategy at the end of the lesson meaning that it didn't have as much benefit as it could have done if I had found it at the start of the lesson. At the start of the lesson I had done 14% of the overall topic and now I have increased to 23%.

 

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

The thing that hindered my learning was my concentration because when I was stuck on a question I didn't read what you had to do again nor did I try to complete the exercise with all of my concentration on it which meant I did not get the answer of the question. I also need to work on my reading skills so that nearly everything that I read stays in my head rather than just slipping out every time I need that certain tip.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next time I will try and give all my attention to every question so I will actually learn not just copy and I will also try to speed up my learning so I don't get too far behind.
