**1st blog of the year                     ****15/09/16**

**Starting point:**

Computer setup

**Target for the lesson:**

Code the computer to say hello.

**Did I reach my target?**

Yes, I did.

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

Most of the lesson was just talking on how to setup the computer but then after that, I went with a partner and we read through the booklet to see what we were going to do for the lesson. After we setup the computer (which did have a few problems) we started coding what we was supposed to. It ended up saying hello.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I need to try and look for different ways to answer the problem instead of expecting it to be wrong and going straight to the teacher. I also need to look for different ways to do something.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

I need to work a bit more quicker so I can get more done in class and learn more. It will be more exciting if I do more coding, because I can see what I can achieve.
