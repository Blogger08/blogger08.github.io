Lesson Review

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

This lesson I learnt more on the code language python using the website codecademy. It was very similar to last weeks lesson in how I learnt how to do everything be cause most things that I am doing at the moment is new to me. So I used the same strategies as last week which was: read carefully, not to give up and read everything. These help because it means I know the most that I can know before I start the work.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

This lesson was a harder lesson for me as it tested me much more than last. This is mostly because the work was more advanced than last week's first timer lesson. What I need to do is follow my three tips as they will help me as long as I do them and not give up at the first hurdle.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next time I will try and concentrate on the work rather than just thinking that I will give up. We also got told about copying each other's work and how it dosen’t help you in the future as you might have done it know but when you go to do a test and you haven’t learn’t how to do than you will be stuck.
