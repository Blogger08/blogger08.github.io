**Guess my number                  ****28/11/16**

**Starting point:**

Having a basic code with nothing to fancy

**Target for the lesson:**

To improve my code

**Did I reach my target?**

We finished the stage in the booklet.

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

This lesson was a very slow lesson at first as the other class's teacher didn’t come in time for the lesson to start so our teacher had to teach both lessons. He eventually came but was around five minutes late. Firstly we had to show up our blogs which if they were not good enough a detention would be on the cards for you. In this lesson we added more detail into the code by adding more speech to our code which included if you didn’t get the number in 10 turns it would say 'better luck next time’ or if you guessed over 100 it would would tell you that it is 1-100 silly. What me and my partner have been doing since the start of the term is one person reads and the other person writes. This is very successful because it speeds the whole process up so no one person’s brain has to do more things than they could.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

As you know at the star of the lesson the other teacher wasn't there so it meant we couldn’t have done the amount of work which we would have liked to have done. Also my partner was in a very sleepy mood today so everything that he said to me was around what you were supposed to write so when we went to run the code there were lots of problems on lots of lines. Another thing was that we didn’t know where we had finished last lesson so we didnt know what part of the code we were on. This didn’t help because we could have been deleting stuff that the code would need to work also it could have been that we were meant to add the code onto the end of the code. This is probably why the code didn’t work.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next time I will remember where i finished in the lesson so nothing like this happens again and make my partner write because i was the only person to write something in todays lesson.
