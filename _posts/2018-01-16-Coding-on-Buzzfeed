**The start of buzzfeed?                              05****/02/18**

**Starting point:**

Using own knowledge and tips from the previous lesson.

**Target for the lesson:**

To start the basic code.

**Did I reach my target?**

The base code carried on through to homework.

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

The best strategies was using your own knowledge and common sense to use what the teacher taught you at the start of the lesson. The teacher gave us the code on how he would start the code and from there we would understand what every function and variable did and change the code to match your code. 

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I believe the main thing that limited my learning was my understanding for each function. This would have made me more confident in what I need to do instead of making it feel like something that will be impossible and I would never be able to achieve.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next time I will ask in lots of detail what I am struggling with only after I have thoroughly worked out what the problem is.
