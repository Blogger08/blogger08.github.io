**Coding on Buzzfeed?                                  ****15/01/17**

**Starting point:**

Using own knowledge

**Target for the lesson:**

To create a quiz and start planning to code

**Did I reach my target?**

I had the basic parts of my quiz decided

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

THis lesson the most effective way to learn was to look at other peoples work and decide on how we could improve it to make own work better or how we could include into our work. WE also had to look further into the code so we could work out how our 'buzzfeed quiz' would find end and the result would be given.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I believe the main thing that limited my learning in today's lesson was the buzzfeed quizzes. This is because it gave me a false sense of direction in how we are going to code this quiz as some of the answers that the website gave you after finishing the quiz were very ridiculous.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next time I will keep my head in the right mood and use my already known knowledge to help me start coding the quiz. I will also not rush into anything and think about what the code needs to have in it before I start my quiz.
