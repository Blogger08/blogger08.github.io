Lesson Review

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

This lesson was all about perseverance, determination and not giving up even if I found it difficult. It made me realise that I need to read things on the page that I had never read before because it doesn't directly help you with the work that you are doing. In one section I stopped working on it as I had been on it for a long time and went on to the next section which ended up helping me with the work that I couldn't do.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

My understanding for what I was doing limited me from doing some work as in the easier sections of this course it was very easy as it told you what to do so all the simple stuff that it told you went in one ear and came back out of the other. 

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**
