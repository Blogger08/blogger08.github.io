Lesson Review

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

This lesson was all about persevering and not giving up at the first hurdle because if I had done that I wouldn't have got anywhere in the lesson. When I was stuck on a exercise I went through a few basic steps as I knew if I did the basic stuff I would be able to find a way to complete. This mainly included going back to past tasks because it always gave me how to do the question but in a simpler way. This is an alternative to using the hint as I didnâ€™t want to use it as much.

 

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

The main thing that limited my learning was my thinking and to think in lots of different ways. I started using past exercises to give me the answer but in theory I was only learning half the stuff that I could have. If I just thought in a direct way and an outside of the box way I would have covered much more of the exercises.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next time I will use my brain a bit more because I will learn more and it will help me for the next exercises.
