**Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication                                     ****4/12/17**

**Starting point:**

Remembering from last term

**Target for the lesson:**

To understand how to use the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

**Did I reach my target?**

I understood the basics of the mathematics in coding.

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

I learnt by listening and trying to understand the code that he was writing on the board. This helped me a lot so I could understand what was trying to be explained in the code. This also meant that if I did this I could break seperate parts of the code down which could help me in my future learning.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I think my learning habits affected my learning in today's lesson. It was that I couldn't keep concentrated  for all the time the teacher was talking and I would have found it much more beneficial if there was a short explanation and then work on what the the teacher said. And do this multiple times, rather than doing one long talk and remembering then trying to remember what to do at the start.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next week I will stay fully concentrated throughout the whole lesson as I know it will really help me in the later bit of the lesson.
